Markov takes out his Snakes and Ladders game, stares at the board and wonders: "If I can always roll the die to whatever number I want,
what would be the least number of rolls to reach the destination?"

- Rules The game is played with a cubic die of  faces numbered  to .
1. Starting from square , land on square  with the exact roll of the die. If moving the number rolled would place the player beyond square,
no move is made.
2. If a player lands at the base of a ladder, the player must climb the ladder. Ladders go up only.
3. If a player lands at the mouth of a snake, the player must go down the snake and come out through the tail. Snakes go down only.

- Input Format:
The first line contains the number of tests, t.
For each testcase:
- The first line contains n, the number of ladders.
- Each of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers, the start and end of a ladder.
- The next line contains the integer m, the number of snakes.
- Each of the next m lines contains two space-separated integers, the start and end of a snake.

- Constaints:
1 <= t <= 10
1 <= n, m <= 15
The board is always 10x10 with squares numbered 1 to 100.
Neither square 1 nor square 100 will be the starting point of a ladder or snake.
A square will have at most one endpoint from either a snake or a ladder.

- Output Format:
For each of the t test cases, print the least number of rolls to move from start to finish on a separate line. If there is no solution, 
print -1.

81 3
59 5
79 23
53 7
43 33
77 21 

Output:
3
5

Explanation:
For the first test:

The player can roll a 5 and a 6 to land at square 12. There is a ladder to square 98. A roll of 2 ends the traverse in 3 rolls.

For the second test:

The player first rolls 5 and climbs the ladder to square 80. Three rolls of 6 get to square 98. A final roll of 2 lands on the target 
square in 5 total rolls.
